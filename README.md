# Plastic Brain
> 3D real-time representation system of the brain activity.

Project created by Manik Bhattacharjee and Pierre Deman - see http://www.pyvotons.org/?page_id=377

Developed during the HUG Hackathon 2018 - see https://hackathon-hug-2018.sparkboard.com/project/5aa673d63feea30400b6362e and https://github.com/HUGrealtimeplasticbrain/realtimeEEGanalysis 

This repository is from the [2019 Brainhack Geneva hackathon](https://brainhack.ch/) and yielded the first functional prototype.

Project 07: PlasticBrain: real-time brain activity on a 3D printed brain


![](brain_sim.jpg)

## Work flow

1. Arduino + Neopixel RGB LED strips (5V 4A power supply, LED strip signal from arduino pin 6, single LED in pin1/ground to display signal reception, power supply and USB grounds must be connected, capacitor connected between + and - of power supply to regulated power fluctuations due to LEDs lighting variations)
2. Hardware : 3D printed brain (cortical surface extracted with Brainvisa - http://brainvisa.info )
3. EEG Acquisition with LabStreamingLayer
4. EEG Filtering using MNE, PYCNBI and SCIPY
5. Inverse Problem (Sources Localization - matrix generated with Cartool)
6. Sources to LED Matrix scripts/sources2leds.csv (matrix generated by scripts/sources2leds.py using manually entered closest source in cartool for each LED data/leds.csv)
7. Communication with the hardware (serial USB connexion to Arduino).

## Install
* Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/brainhack-ch/plastic-brain.git
```
* Install the packages and dependencies...
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Compile and load in your Arduino (with the arduino IDE) the file scripts/signal2ligth/signal2ligth.ino
* Get an EEG system than can send its data in realtime using LSL (Lab Streaming Layer)

## Running:

* Connect the arduino to your USB port.
* Start the EEG data stream in your local network.
* Run the main code:
```
python BrainHackScripts/brainHack.py
```
